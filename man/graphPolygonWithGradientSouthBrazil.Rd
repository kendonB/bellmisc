}
\arguments{
\item{colourVar}{numeric variable that defines the gradient
colour. Same length and order as dataPoly.}

\item{dataPoly}{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to be plotted.}

\item{legendTitle}{legend title as character.}

\item{fileName}{filename (not with directory or extension) as character.}

\item{directoryPlots}{directory to store plots}

\item{backPolygon}{optional background polygon to be
plotted on top of - fortified or raw (prefortifying will be faster if
several maps are being generated).}

\item{brewerPalette}{brewer palette name as character. Default is "Spectral".}

\item{rev}{logical to indicate if Brewer colours should be reversed.}
